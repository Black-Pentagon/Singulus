# Singulus

An Android App for class attendance, timetable and event updates.

How many times does It happen that one of your faculties is absent or a class is changed due to other reasons but you are not informed?
How many times does it happen that an important detail was needed to be circulated but your incharge is either late or hasnâ€™t informed?
How many times does it happen that your faculty has not taken the attendance because it is very time-consuming with that primitive way of marking with pen and paper or Your attendance in college records is wrong because your incharge filled incorrect entries?
There is still a gap between teachers and students.

So, the idea is to integrate the whole institute with one app, which is less time consuming, technologically secured and very dynamic. It would help teacher to take attendance quicker than primitive pen paper method. A dynamic timetable where,swap in lectures and classrooms can be updated momentarily. Teachers can update about upcoming event, exam schedules etc to chosen student body.
